LESS
----

  LESS 1.0.1
  ----------------------
  
  Big changes are coming to LESS!
  
  We are about to merge a lot of  changes into LESS to improve of features
  across the board and fix a bunch of bugs. To make the move as smooth as
  possible we'll be doing a period of beta releases.
  To use those beta's, you can subscribe to pre-releases by editing your
  Package Control preferences and adding LESS to the "install_prereleases" key:
  
  "install_prereleases":
  [
    "LESS"
  ]
  
  If you find any bugs, please let us know:
